This study explores a promising solution â€“encryption systems based on supersingular isogenies, including the Supersingular Isogeny
Diffie-Hellman protocol. These systems leverage well-studied isogenies and offer decent
performance with compact key sizes, setting them apart from other post-quantum contenders. We delve into the mathematical foundations, key protocols, and innovative
adaptations of established schemes in the supersingular isogeny context. While these
cryptographic schemes exhibit promise in terms of performance and quantum resistance,
they introduce increased protocol complexity, presenting a notable trade-of
